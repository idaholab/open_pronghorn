ERCOFTAC Case 030: BFS with Inclined Opposite Wall

Scripts for the input files, mesh files, and Python plots are courtesy of
Mauricio Tano and edited by Hailey Tran-Kieu in collaboration with Guillaume Giudicelli, Peter German, and Ramiro Freile.

Media files such as .png of plots are generated by the bfs_plot.py scripts located both in the current directory and at doc/content/media/validation/free_flow/isothermal/ercoftac_030_bfs.

A performance script bfs_performance.py is located in doc/content/media/validation/free_flow/isothermal/ercoftac_030_bfs with the original script courtesy of Peter German. The script still needs to be tested and implemented into the documentation.
